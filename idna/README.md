# `idna`

IDNA library for Rust implementing [UTS 46: Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/) as parametrized by the [WHATWG URL Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#idna).

## What it does

* An implementation of UTS 46 is provided, with configurable ASCII deny list (e.g. STD3 or WHATWG rules).
* A callback mechanism is provided for pluggable logic for deciding if a label is deemed potentially too misleading to render as Unicode in a user interface.
* Errors are marked as U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs in Unicode output so that locations of errors may be illustrated to the user.

## What it does not do

* There is no default/sample policy provided for the callback mechanism mentioned above.
* Earlier variants of IDNA (2003, 2008) are not implementedâ€”only UTS 46.
* There is no API for categorizing errors beyond there being an error.
* Checks that are configurable in UTS 46 but that the WHATWG URL Standard always set a particular way (regardless of the _beStrict_ flag in the URL Standard) cannot be configured (with the exception of the old deprecated API supporting transitional processing).

## Usage

Apps that need to prepare a hostname for usage in protocols are likely to only need the top-level function `domain_to_ascii_cow` with `AsciiDenyList::URL` as the second argument. Note that this rejects IPv6 addresses, so before this, you need to check if the first byte of the input is `b'['` and, if it is, treat the input as an IPv6 address instead.

Apps that need to display host names to the user should use `uts46::Uts46::to_user_interface`. The _ToUnicode_ operation is rarely appropriate for direct application usage.

## Known spec violations

* The `verify_dns_length` behavior that this crate implements allows a trailing dot in the input as required by the UTS 46 test suite despite the UTS 46 spec saying that this isn't allowed.

## Breaking changes since 0.5.0

* IDNA 2008 rules are no longer supported. Attempting to enable them panics immediately. UTS 46 allows all the names that IDNA 2008 allows, and when transitional processing is disabled, they resolve to the name names. There are additional names that IDNA 2008 disallows but UTS 46 maps to names that IDNA 2008 allows (notably, upper-case input is mapped to lower-case output). UTS 46 also allows symbols that were allowed in IDNA 2003 as well as newer symbols that are allowed according to the same principle.
* `domain_to_ascii_strict` now performs the _CheckHyphens_ check (matching previous documentation).
* The ContextJ rules are now implemented and always enabled, so input that fails those rules is rejected.
* The `Idna::to_ascii_inner` method has been removed. It didn't make sense as a public method, since callers were unable to figure out if there were errors. (A GitHub search found no callers for this method.)
* Punycode labels whose decoding does not yield any non-ASCII characters are now treated as being in error.
